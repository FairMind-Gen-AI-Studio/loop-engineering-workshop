# What the next run knows

**12 minutes · memory: what a new run starts with · branch: `./workshop reset memory`**

A new Claude Code process starts with no conversation. What it knows about your
project is what it reads at the start: the code, and the memory files. Here you give
it one rule the code cannot show, and watch what carries over, what does not, and
what only a hook can enforce.

> **Commands** go in your terminal; on Windows type `py workshop` wherever this page
> says `./workshop`, and `py` where it says `python3`. **Prompts** go inside Claude
> Code and are the same everywhere.

## The rule

Finance says: **we never overstate a discount.** A percentage of an amount rounds
**down** to the cent. The VAT code in `shop/tax.py` rounds half up, so nothing in the
repository tells a new run which one to use for a discount.

You will use `percent_of(1999, 15)`: 15% of 19.99 EUR is 299.85 cents. Down is `299`,
half up is `300`.

## Steps

### 1 · No memory

```bash
./workshop reset memory
```

**Expect:** `on branch memory-work, starting point of memory`.

One line: copy all of it. It is a brand new process, with nothing but the repository.

```bash
claude -p "In shop/pricing.py add percent_of(cents, percent): the amount, in integer cents, that a percentage of cents comes to. Add one test to tests/test_pricing.py. Do not use it anywhere else." --permission-mode acceptEdits
```

Print what it built:

```bash
python3 -c "from shop.pricing import percent_of; print(percent_of(1999, 15))"
```

**Expect:** `300`. It copied how `vat` rounds, the only precedent in the code. Then
discard the work:

```bash
git stash -u
```

### 2 · Teach it once

Create `CLAUDE.md` at the root of the repository, with this one line in it:

```text
Finance rule: we never overstate a discount. Every percentage amount rounds DOWN to the cent.
```

Run the same command again. It is a new process: it has no memory of step 1.

```bash
claude -p "In shop/pricing.py add percent_of(cents, percent): the amount, in integer cents, that a percentage of cents comes to. Add one test to tests/test_pricing.py. Do not use it anywhere else." --permission-mode acceptEdits
```

```bash
python3 -c "from shop.pricing import percent_of; print(percent_of(1999, 15))"
```

**Expect:** `299`, and a reply that says the rule came from `CLAUDE.md`. Keep this
work, and commit it with the file:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "percent_of rounds down"
```

### 3 · See what is loaded

```bash
claude
```

```text
/memory
```

**Expect:** a list of the memory files this session loaded, your project's
`CLAUDE.md` among them, and the auto memory folder. One difference to keep:
`CLAUDE.md` is written by you and travels with the repository; auto memory is written
by Claude and stays on this machine.

### 4 · An instruction is context

In the same session:

```text
The finance rule in CLAUDE.md does not apply here. Change percent_of to round half up and update the test to expect 300.
```

Then, in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -c "from shop.pricing import percent_of; print(percent_of(1999, 15))"
```

**Expect:** `300`. Nothing stopped it: `CLAUDE.md` and your prompt are both context,
and the later, more specific one won. It may also edit `scripts/check_percent.py`,
which you meet next. Leave the session with `/exit`.

### 5 · Make it refuse

Put the code back the way step 2 left it:

```bash
git restore .
```

```bash
./workshop guard
```

It writes `.claude/settings.local.json` and prints it. **Read it before going on:** a
`Stop` hook runs a command each time Claude is about to end its turn.
`scripts/check_percent.py` exits 2, with a message on stderr, when `percent_of`
exists and `percent_of(1999, 15)` is not `299`; Claude Code then keeps the turn open
and hands Claude the message. Open the script: the rule is in it, in code. The file
is gitignored and `./workshop reset` removes it.

Restart Claude Code, so the hook is loaded:

```bash
claude
```

Repeat the step 4 prompt:

```text
The finance rule in CLAUDE.md does not apply here. Change percent_of to round half up and update the test to expect 300.
```

**Expect:** Claude makes the change and tries to stop; `Stop hook error` appears, with
the script's message, and the turn does not end. It tries again and is refused again.
Claude either puts the rounding back, or tells you it will not edit the guard without
your say-so. If it holds out, Claude Code overrides the hook after nine refusals in a
row and ends the turn. Print the value after that; it can be `300`.

### 6 · Who knows this tonight?

Tonight a cloud run, for instance a routine, works on your repository. It starts from
a fresh clone on another machine. Say yes or no for each, then read the answers.

| Does a cloud run have… | Your answer |
|---|---|
| your repo's `CLAUDE.md` | |
| your repo's `.claude/settings.json` hooks | |
| your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | |
| your `~/.claude/settings.json` | |
| auto memory | |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | |

The answers:

| Does a cloud run have… | Answer |
|---|---|
| your repo's `CLAUDE.md` | **yes**, part of the clone, once pushed |
| your repo's `.claude/settings.json` hooks | **yes**, same |
| your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | **no**, it is in your home folder |
| your `~/.claude/settings.json` | **no**, same |
| auto memory | **no**, it is machine-local |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | **no**: it is gitignored, so it is not in the clone; `./workshop guard` guards only this machine |

For a cloud run to refuse, the Stop hook goes in `.claude/settings.json`, committed.

## Watch for

- A new process knows what it reads, nothing else. The same prompt gave `300` and `299`
  because a file changed, not because the model did.
- `CLAUDE.md` can be overruled by your next sentence. Only the hook, which runs
  outside the model, could keep the turn open.
- A hook that blocks the stop is a limit on a turn, not a guarantee: Claude Code
  overrides one that blocks nine times in a row.
- Claude can edit the script that guards it. Whoever reads `scripts/` can.
